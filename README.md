# 💡 Light86
Light86 is a torch app with advanced capabilities (like torch intensity) for ZenFone 2 and ZenFone Zoom. The camera flash is turned on by a kernel command and, unlike most torch apps, Light86 doesn't access the device's camera, making it faster, saving battery and keeping the LED on for more time.

💡 It doesn't need camera permissions, too! 💡

💡 In the near future, with help of a custom flash driver, it will be possible to choose each LED intensity independently 💡

💡 The work in this application will serve as base for a more advanced slow-sync feature for Raw Dumper 💡

⚠️ Note: it will probably require root if selinux is set to enforcing mode ⚠️
