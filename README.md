# ðŸ’¡ Light86
Light86 is a torch app with advanced capabilities (like torch intensity) for ZenFone 2 and ZenFone Zoom. The camera flash is turned on by a kernel command and, unlike most torch apps, Light86 doesn't access the device's camera, saving battery and keeping the LED on for more time.

ðŸ’¡ It also doesn't need camera permissions ðŸ’¡
